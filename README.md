**The Venture Capital Fundraising Tool was inspired by the (commonly ignored) increasing impacts that networks have on business outcomes.**  Building strategic relations with investors in the venture capital ecosystem is a method of deal sourcing often employed by VCs. However, when VCs struggle to identify key investors in an objective fashion, it is common practice for VCs to focus on coinvestors that they already know, rather than the ones that they should know. Hence, we believe that networks play a more crucial role in the success in venture capital land than most choose to believe, and that network analysis can be used to rank the "successfulness" of coinvestors in a given VC community.
